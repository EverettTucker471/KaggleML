# Spaceship Titanic

* This is a classification problem that seeks to predict the survivibility of passengers abord a spaceship, based on a diverse set of features
* It stresses feature engineering and data preprocessing over model selection
* My model predicts survivibility with a 79.822% accuracy, which is in the 62nd percentile of teams on Kaggle
